# Implementation Summary: Live Goal Detection

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Maple Leafs Discord bot now has fully functional live goal detection with all requirements met.

## What Changed

### Modified Files

  - Added `getGameFeed` import
  - Created `createGoalEmbed()` function (93 lines)
  - Rewrote `checkForGameUpdates()` function (191 lines)
  - Added `sendGoalToChannels()` helper (27 lines)

### New Files
- **GOAL_DETECTION.md** (149 lines)
  - Complete technical documentation
  - Data structures and API endpoints
  - Error handling and maintenance guide

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
Every 60 seconds:
  ↓
Check for live Leafs game (schedule API)
  ↓
If game is LIVE/CRIT:
  ↓
Fetch game status (landing API) ← Current score, period, time
  ↓
Fetch play-by-play (play-by-play API) ← All events including goals
  ↓
Filter for goal events (typeDescKey === 'goal')
  ↓
Compare with lastScoringIdx ← Track what we've already posted
  ↓
For each NEW goal:
  ├─ Extract: scorer, assists, strength, period, time
  ├─ Build rich Discord embed
  └─ Send to all configured channels
  ↓
Update lastScoringIdx ← Prevent duplicates
```

## Example Goal Post

When Auston Matthews scores a power play goal, the bot posts:

```
🚨 GOAL! BOS 1 – 2 TOR

🏒 Scorer
Auston Matthews #34

🎯 Assists
Mitchell Marner #16, Morgan Rielly #44

💪 Strength    ⏱️ Time
PP             P2 5:23

🎯 Shot Type
Wrist
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Deduplication System
- Uses index-based tracking (`lastScoringIdx`)
- Survives bot restarts
- Never posts same goal twice

### ✅ All Goal Types Supported
- **EV** - Even strength (5v5)
- **PP** - Power play
- **SH** - Short-handed
- **EN** - Empty net
- **PS** - Penalty shot
- **OT** - Overtime goals
- **SO** - Shootout goals

### ✅ Safe Fallbacks
Every field has a fallback value to prevent "undefined" in embeds:
- Missing scorer → "Unknown"
- No assists → "Unassisted"
- Missing strength → "EV"
- Missing time → "TBD"
- Missing period → "P1"

### ✅ Comprehensive Logging
```
🏒 Started tracking game 2024020100
📊 Game 2024020100: Found 3 total goals, last processed index: 1
🚨 New goal detected at index 2: { eventId: 180, period: 2, time: '8:15', team: 'TOR' }
✅ Goal update sent to guild 123456, channel 789012
🏁 Game 2024020100 ended. Stopping tracking.
```

## Testing Results

All tests passing! ✅

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Goal filtering (3/3 goals found)
- ✅ Deduplication - same run (0 duplicates)
- ✅ Deduplication - bot restart (1 new goal only)
- ✅ Scorer extraction (with and without data)
- ✅ Assists extraction (with and without data)
- ✅ Strength detection (EV, PP, SH, EN)

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Full workflow simulation
- ✅ Game tracking initialization
- ✅ Multiple goals in single run
- ✅ No duplicates on subsequent checks
- ✅ Bot restart with new goals

### Safety Tests
- ✅ Minimal/missing data handling
- ✅ All fields return proper types
- ✅ No "undefined" in any field

### Security
- ✅ CodeQL scan: 0 vulnerabilities found

## Configuration

### Current Settings
- **Polling interval**: 60 seconds
- **Rate limiting**: 1 second between API calls
- **Timezone**: America/New_York (EST/EDT)

### Adjustable Parameters
To poll faster during live games, modify in `index.js`:
```javascript
// Line 80: Change from 60000 (60s) to 15000 (15s)
startGameUpdateChecker(15000);
```

## Bot Commands (Unchanged)

Users configure channels with existing commands:
- `/setup-leafs-updates` - Enable goal updates in a channel
- `/stop-leafs-updates` - Disable goal updates
- `/next-leafs-game` - View next scheduled game

## API Endpoints Used

1. **Schedule**: `https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/club-schedule/TOR/week/now`
   - Finds current/upcoming games

2. **Landing**: `https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/{gameId}/landing`
   - Gets current score and game state

3. **Play-by-Play**: `https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/{gameId}/play-by-play`
   - Gets all game events including goals

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Goals detected from play-by-play data
- [x] Rich embeds with all required fields
- [x] No duplicate posts (same run)
- [x] No duplicate posts (after restart)
- [x] Handle PP/SH/EV/EN/PS/OT/SO goals

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for production use. Optional enhancements:

1. **Dynamic Polling** - Poll every 10-15s during live games, 60s otherwise
2. **Player Avatars** - Add scorer headshots to embeds
3. **Video Highlights** - Link to NHL.com goal clips
4. **Goal History** - Command to view all goals in current game

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check logs for `🚨 New goal detected` messages
2. Verify play-by-play API returns goal events
3. Review `GOAL_DETECTION.md` for technical details
4. Check that bot has message send permissions in channels
